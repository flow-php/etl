## Description

Flow is a most advanced and flexible PHP, data processing library that is designed according to Filters & Pipes architecture.

Besides typical ETL use cases (Extract, Transform, Load), Flow can be also used for memory-safe data analysis.

By default all operations are synchronous, but for bigger datasets Flow offers an asynchronous pipeline. 

## Installation

```bash
composer require flow-php/etl:1.x@dev
```

## Typical Use Cases

* Sync data from external systems (API)
* File processing
* Pushing data to external systems
* Data migrations

Using this library makes sense when we need to move data from one place to another, doing some transformations in between.

For example, let's say we must synchronize data from external API periodically, transform them into our internal
data structure, filter out things that didn't change, and load in bulk into the database.

This is a perfect scenario for ETL.

## Usage

```php
<?php 

ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->load($loader)
    ->run();
```

## Features

* Low memory consumption even when processing thousands of records
* Type safe Rows/Row/Entry abstractions
* Filtering
* Built in Rows objects comparison
* Rich collection of Row Entries 

## Row Entries

### Serialization

In order to allow serialization of callable based transformers please
add into your dependencies [opis/closure](https://github.com/opis/closure) library:

```
{
  "require": {
    "opis/closure": "^3.5"
  }
}
```


### Custom Transformer

> If possible it's recommended to avoid writing custom transformers. Official transformers are optimized
> again internal mechanisms which you might not be able to achieve in your custom code.


Custom should only implement `Transformer` interface:

Example:
```php
<?php

use Flow\ETL\Transformer;
use Flow\ETL\Rows;

class NotNorbertTransformer implements Transformer
{
    public function transform(Rows $rows) : Rows
    {
        return $rows->filter(fn(Row $row) => $row->get('name')->value() !== "Norbert");
    }
}
```

## Extractors

In most cases Extractors should be provided by Adapters which you can find below, however there are few generic extractors,
please find them below.  
Please read [tests](tests/Flow/ETL/Tests/Unit/Extractor) to find examples of usage.

* [memory](src/Flow/ETL/Extractor/MemoryExtractor.php) - [tests](tests/Flow/ETL/Tests/Unit/Extractor/MemoryExtractorTest.php)

## Adapters

Adapter connects ETL with existing data sources/storages and including some times custom 
data entries. 

<table style="text-align:center">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Extractor (read)</th>
    <th>Loader (write)</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/flow-php/etl-adapter-doctrine">Doctrine - DB</a></td>
      <td>✅</td>
      <td>✅</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/flow-php/etl-adapter-elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a></td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>✅</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/flow-php/etl-adapter-csv">CSV</a></td>
      <td>✅</td>
      <td>✅</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

      <td>🚫</td>
      <td>✅</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

* ✅ - at least one implementation is available 
* 🚫 - implementation not possible
* `N/A` - not available yet 

**❗ If adapter that you are looking for is not available yet, and you are willing to work on one, feel free to create one as a standalone repository.**
**Well designed and documented adapters can be pulled into `flow-php` organization that will give them maintenance and security support from the organization.** 

## Asynchronous Processing

Flow PHP allows asynchronous processing that can drastically increase processing power.
Asynchronous processing is still under development, the latest progress is available in [flow-php/etl-async](https://github.com/flow-php/etl-async) repository.

## Error Handling 

In case of any exception in transform/load steps, ETL process will break, in order
to change that behavior please set custom [ErrorHandler](src/Flow/ETL/ErrorHandler.php). 

Error Handler defines 3 behavior using 2 methods. 

* `ErrorHandler::throw(\Throwable $error, Rows $rows) : bool`
* `ErrorHandler::skipRows(\Throwable $error, Rows $rows) : bool`

If `throw` returns true, ETL will simply throw an error.
If `skipRows' returns true, ETL will stop processing given rows, and it will try to move to the next batch.
If both methods returns false, ETL will continue processing Rows using next transformers/loaders.

There are 3 build in ErrorHandlers (look for more in adapters):

* [ignore error](src/Flow/ETL/ErrorHandler/IgnoreError.php)
* [skip rows](src/Flow/ETL/ErrorHandler/SkipRows.php)
* [throw error](src/Flow/ETL/ErrorHandler/ThrowError.php)

Error Handling can be set directly at ETL:

```php
<?php 

ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->onError(new IgnoreError())
    ->transform($transformer)
    ->load($loader)
    ->run();
```

## Sort By 

Thanks to implementation of External Sort algorithm, sorting as everything else
is by default memory-safe. This means, that even sorting 10gb file if doable
in just few megabytes of RAM. 


```php
<?php 

$rows = ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->collect()
    ->sortBy(Sort::desc('price'))
    ->fetch();
```

Please remember that sort is an expensive operation, usually datasets are either 
loaded into destination storages, or reduced by filtering/grouping. 
Sorting needs to go through entire dataset and sort all Rows regardless of how 
big the dataset is compared to available memory. In order to achieve
that, External Sort is using cache which relays on I/O that might become a bottleneck. 

## Cache 

The goal of cache is to serialize and save on disk (or in other location defined by Cache implementation)
already transformer dataset. 

Cache will run a pipeline, catching each Rows and saving them into cache 
from where those rows can be later extracted. 

This is useful for operations that requires full transformation of dataset before
moving forward, like for example sorting.

Another interesting use case for caching would be to share the dataset between multiple ETL's.
So instead of going to datasource multiple times and then repeating all transformations, only one ETL would
do the whole job and others could benefit from the final form of dataset in a memory-safe way. 

```php
<?php 

ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->cache()
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->load($loader)
    ->run();
```

## Collect/Parallelize

```php
<?php 

ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->collect()
    ->load($loader)
    ->run();
```

Flow PHP ETL is designed to keep memory consumption constant. This can be achieved by processing
only one chunk of data at time.

It's `Extrator` responsibility to define how big those chunks are, for example when processing CSV file with 10k
lines, extractor might want to read only 1k lines at once.

Those 1k lines will be represented as an instance of `Rows`. This means that through ETL pipeline we are
going to push 10 rows, 1k row each.

Main purpose of methods `ETL::collect()` and `ETL::parallelize()` is to adjust number of rows in the middle of processing.

This means that Extractor can still extract 1k rows at once, but before using loader we can use `ETL::collect` which
will wait for all rows to get extracted, then it will merge them and pass total 10k rows into `Loader`.

Parallelize method is exactly opposite, it will not wait for all Rows in order to collect them, instead it will
take any incoming Rows instance and split it into smaller chunks according to `ETL::parallelize(int $chunks)` method `chunks` argument.

```php
<?php 

ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->load($loader1)
    ->parallelize(20)
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->transform($transformer4)
    ->load($loader2)
    ->run();
```

## Limit 

Because sometimes you might just want to process first 10 rows. 
In this example, Pipeline will take only 5 rows from Extractor passing them through all transformers. 

Because pipeline execution is delayed, limit function can be used in any place, before: 

- `ETL::run()`
- `ETL::fetch()`
- `ETL::display()`

```php
<?php 

ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->transform($transformer4)
    ->loader($loader)
    ->limit(5)
    ->run();
```


## Fetch

Loaders are a great way to load `Rows` into specific Data Sink, however sometimes
you want to simply grab Rows and do something with them. 

```php
<?php 

$rows = ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->transform($transformer4)
    ->fetch();
```

If `ETL::fetch(int $limit = 0) : Rows` limit argument is different than 0, fetch will
return no more rows than requested. 

## Process

Sometimes you might already have `Rows` prepared, in that case instead of going
through Extractors just use `ETL::process(Rows $rows) : ETL`. 

```php 
<?php 

ETL::process(new Rows(...))
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->transform($transformer4)
    ->load($loader)
    ->run();
```

## Display

Display is probably the easiest way to debug ETL's, by default
it will grab selected number of rows (20 by default)

```php
<?php 

$output = ETL::extract($extractor)
    ->transform($transformer1)
    ->transform($transformer2)
    ->transform($transformer3)
    ->transform($transformer4)
    ->display($limit = 5, $truncate = 0);
    
echo $output;
```

Output:

```

```

## Performance

The most important thing about performance to remember is that creating custom Loaders/Transformers might have negative impact to
processing performance.

#### ETL::collect()

Using collect on a large number of rows might end up without of memory exception, but it can also significantly increase
loading time into datasink. It might be cheaper to do one big insert than multiple smaller inserts.

## Development

In order to install dependencies please, launch following commands:

```bash
composer install
```

## Run Tests

In order to execute full test suite, please launch following command:

```bash
composer build
```

It's recommended to use [pcov](https://pecl.php.net/package/pcov) for code coverage however you can also use
xdebug by setting `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage` env variable.
